      <article class="post-content"><p>There's something deeply satisfying about building things from scratch. Whether it's a piece of software, a website, or even a simple script that automates a tedious task — the act of creation is rewarding in itself.</p>
<p>I've been thinking a lot lately about what makes a project worth building. It's not always about solving a big problem or creating the next groundbreaking tool. Sometimes, the most meaningful projects are the ones that scratch a personal itch.</p>
<h2>Start Small</h2>
<p>The best advice I've ever received about building things is to start small. Don't try to build the perfect version on day one. Ship something, learn from it, and iterate.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The secret to getting ahead is getting started.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This applies to everything — from writing your first blog post to launching a side project. The hardest part is always the beginning. Once you start, momentum carries you forward.</p>
<h2>Keep It Simple</h2>
<p>Simplicity is not about doing less. It's about focusing on what matters. Every feature you add, every line of code you write should serve a purpose. If it doesn't, it's just noise.</p>
<p>This blog itself is an exercise in simplicity. No frameworks, no build tools, no unnecessary complexity. Just HTML, CSS, and words.</p>
<hr />
<p>If you've been thinking about building something — start today. It doesn't have to be perfect. It just has to exist.</p></article>
