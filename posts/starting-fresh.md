There's something liberating about a blank page. No baggage, no legacy decisions, no "we've always done it this way." Just possibility.

I've started this blog as a fresh beginning. A place to collect my thoughts, document what I'm learning, and share ideas that I find worth exploring. No pressure, no schedule — just writing when something feels worth putting into words.

## Why a Blog?

In a world of tweets and short-form content, a blog might seem old-fashioned. But I think there's value in long-form thinking. Some ideas need space to breathe, room to develop, and the patience to unfold at their own pace.

A blog is also a record. A trail of thoughts you can look back on and see how your thinking has evolved. That alone makes it worth doing.

## What to Expect

I'll write about technology, software, design, and whatever else catches my attention. Some posts will be practical — things I've learned, tools I've found useful, problems I've solved. Others will be more reflective — thoughts on creativity, work, and how we interact with the digital world.

If even one person finds something useful or interesting here, that's a win. But honestly, I'm writing this mostly for myself. And that's okay too.

Here's to new beginnings.
