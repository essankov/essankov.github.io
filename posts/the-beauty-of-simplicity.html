        <p>We live in a world that constantly pushes us toward complexity. More features, more options, more everything. But there's a quiet elegance in choosing less — in stripping away the unnecessary until only the essential remains.</p>

        <p>Design, at its best, is invisible. You don't notice it because it doesn't get in the way. It simply works. The best tools, the best interfaces, the best writing — they all share this quality of effortless clarity.</p>

        <h2>Less, but Better</h2>

        <p>Dieter Rams said it best: "Less, but better." This isn't about minimalism for its own sake. It's about intentionality. Every element should earn its place.</p>

        <p>Think about the websites you enjoy visiting. Chances are, they're the ones that load fast, present information clearly, and don't assault you with popups, notifications, and visual clutter.</p>

        <h2>Simplicity in Code</h2>

        <p>The same principle applies to code. The best code is the code you don't write. Every line is a potential bug, a maintenance burden, a source of complexity. Write what you need, nothing more.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Antoine de Saint-Exupery wrote that about airplanes, but it applies beautifully to software, to design, and to life in general.</p>

        <hr>

        <p>The next time you're tempted to add just one more thing, pause and ask: does this serve the purpose? If not, leave it out. The result will be better for it.</p>
