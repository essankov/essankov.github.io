We live in a world that constantly pushes us toward complexity. More features, more options, more everything. But there's a quiet elegance in choosing less — in stripping away the unnecessary until only the essential remains.

Design, at its best, is invisible. You don't notice it because it doesn't get in the way. It simply works. The best tools, the best interfaces, the best writing — they all share this quality of effortless clarity.

## Less, but Better

Dieter Rams said it best: "Less, but better." This isn't about minimalism for its own sake. It's about intentionality. Every element should earn its place.

Think about the websites you enjoy visiting. Chances are, they're the ones that load fast, present information clearly, and don't assault you with popups, notifications, and visual clutter.

## Simplicity in Code

The same principle applies to code. The best code is the code you don't write. Every line is a potential bug, a maintenance burden, a source of complexity. Write what you need, nothing more.

> Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.

Antoine de Saint-Exupery wrote that about airplanes, but it applies beautifully to software, to design, and to life in general.

The next time you're tempted to add just one more thing, pause and ask: does this serve the purpose? If not, leave it out. The result will be better for it.
