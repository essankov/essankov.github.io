There's something deeply satisfying about building things from scratch. Whether it's a piece of software, a website, or even a simple script that automates a tedious task — the act of creation is rewarding in itself.

I've been thinking a lot lately about what makes a project worth building. It's not always about solving a big problem or creating the next groundbreaking tool. Sometimes, the most meaningful projects are the ones that scratch a personal itch.

## Start Small

The best advice I've ever received about building things is to start small. Don't try to build the perfect version on day one. Ship something, learn from it, and iterate.

> The secret to getting ahead is getting started.

This applies to everything — from writing your first blog post to launching a side project. The hardest part is always the beginning. Once you start, momentum carries you forward.

## Keep It Simple

Simplicity is not about doing less. It's about focusing on what matters. Every feature you add, every line of code you write should serve a purpose. If it doesn't, it's just noise.

This blog itself is an exercise in simplicity. No frameworks, no build tools, no unnecessary complexity. Just HTML, CSS, and words.

If you've been thinking about building something — start today. It doesn't have to be perfect. It just has to exist.
